# Project: Investigate TMDb Movie Dataset
 
In this report, I explored movie data. I focused on exploring what kinds of properties are associated with movies that have a high vote average and documenting my findings.

## Dataset
This data set is collected from The Movie Database(TMDb) and contains about 10,000 movies. 
This is cleaned from original data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
